# Image Generative AI Project: Enhancing Food and Beverage Visuals

Welcome to the Image Generative AI Project! This repository is dedicated to exploring and improving the visual details of food and beverage images using generative AI techniques. The project is divided into two main components: **scripts** for preprocessing, training, and inference, and a **web application** for interactive model evaluation.

This project is primarily based on the **OmniGen model**, and it provides tools to fine-tune, evaluate, and generate high-quality images from textual and visual inputs.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **`scripts/`**: Contains Python scripts for preprocessing datasets, automating inference, and training models. These scripts are designed to handle input images, output images, and text instructions for generative tasks.
   
2. **`web_app/`**: Houses a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload an image, select a model, and define a prompt to generate a new image. This tool is useful for evaluating the model's behavior under various conditions.

Each folder has its own detailed README file for specific instructions and usage.
